The Mind

Q: This is the idea that the mental world is completely distinct from the physical world.
A: What is Dualism?
Q: This is the idea that mental phenomena are identical to physical phenomena.
A: What is Materialism?
Q: This is the idea that the mind is too difficult to scientifically study, and that instead science should focus on how individuals respond to inputs.
A: What is Behaviorism?
Q: This theory of mind emphasizes removing unscientific language from our folk psychological language.
A: What is eliminative materialism?
Q: This is the version of the Turing Test as described in the original paper.
A: Can a machine play the Imitation Game as well as a human participant?
Q: This is the theory of mind Alan Turing is associated with.
A: What is Functionalism?

The Brain

Q: This specialized cell that transmits nerve impulses.
A: What is a neuron?
Q: This part of a neuron receives electrical signals from other neurons.
A: What are dendrites?
Q: This part of the brain is highly interconnected and involved in emotional decision making.
A: What is the amygdala?
Q: This type of brain damage leads to difficulty producing fluent sentences, but does not affect the ability to comprehend language.
A: What is Broca's Aphasia?
Q: Patients who exhibit damage to this structure typically cannot attend to their left visual field, even though they are not blind.
A: What is the right parietal lobe?
Q: This theory differentiates between higher and lower states of consciousness based on brain activity
A: What is the Integrated Information Theory?

Computation

Q: This type of artificial intelligence takes inspiration from how the human brain works.
A: What are Artificial Neural Networks?
Q: These computer programs aim to build a complete system by combining theories from multiple cognitive systems.
A: What is an integrated model of cognition?
Q: David Marr suggests all three of these are necessary for a complete description of an information processing system.
A: What are the computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels of analysis?
Q: These four things must be defined for a problem if the A* algorithm is to be applied.
A: What are states, actions, costs, and heuristics?
Q: Besides a healthy brain, these three technological components are necessary for a brain-machine interface.
A: What are a sensor, decoder, and user interface (assistive technology)?
Q: This ability allows people (and ideally, computers or networks) to maintain limited functionality even when a large portion of it has been destroyed or rendered inoperative.
A: What is graceful degradation?

Cognitive Psychology

Q: This negative association between a neutral stimulus and a response is a result of repeatedly pairing the neutral stimulus with an aversive unconditioned stimulus.
A: What is fear conditioning?
Q: This problem is caused by the fundamentally ambiguous mapping between sources of retinal stimulation and the retinal images that are caused by those sources.
A: What is the inverse optics problem?
Q: This is the relationship described by Weber's Law?
A: What is the perception of change in a given stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus
Q: In this type of reasoning, the conclusion is always correct if the premises are sound and the structure is valid.
A: What is deductive reasoning?
Q: Two examples of this are ecological and computational.
A: What are types of constraints in bounded rationality?
Q: This type of knowledge that allows us to do things like run, play a musical instrument, or cook dinner.
A: What is procedural knowledge?

Linguistics

Q: The ability for apes to do this bring into question whether non-human animals have language.
A: What is sign language?
Q: In this experiment, people with more words for a color were quicker to distinguish between shades of that color.
A: What is the "Russian Blues" study?
Q: This is how the earliest conversational chatbots work.
A: What is pattern matching based on input sentences?
Q: Noam Chomsky claims that this linguistic structure is universal for all human languages
A: What is recursion/embeddings?
Q: This is known as the nativism versus empiricism debate.
A: Is language inherent in our brain structure, or do we learn it from statistics in the world?
Q: According to Noam Chomsky, the observation that deaf children in Nicaragua developed their own language is evidence for this.
A: A universal, innate, uniquely human language acquisition device in brain.

Miscellaneous

Q: This is acronymized as "WEIRD".
A: What is Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic?
Q: This selection process mediates between sensation and perception
A: What is attention?
Q: This is the idea that the brain can change as one learns and that intelligence is malleable.
A: What is the growth mindset?
Q: Libet's experiment demonstrating neural correlates of action before the conscious decision to move contributes to this debate.
A: What is the free will debate?
Q: This is the idea that perception of a whole object is created by combining the individual features.
A: What is bottom-up processing?
Q: To conceive of an observation or an argument which negates the statement in question is the hallmark of this.
A: What is the scientific method?
